# RAG-GPT4o-ObjectBox-VectorDB
This project builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using OpenAI's GPT-4o (Omni) model and ObjectBox Vector Database. It combines powerful language understanding with efficient vector storage for enhanced data retrieval. The solution is optimized for fast, context-aware responses in large dataset applications.

# 🌟Building RAG With OpenAI GPT-4o(omni) Model Using Objectbox Vector Database💎💫⚡🎯

## Description📝:                                     
- `OpenAI GPT-4o model` is used for creating a `RAG application` using `Object Vector Database`.
- **GPT-4o (“o” for “omni”)** is a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction—it accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs.
- It can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time(opens in a new window) in a conversation.
- It matches `GPT-4 Turbo performance` on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50% cheaper in the API.
- GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models.
