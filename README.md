# RAG-GPT4o-ObjectBox-VectorDB
This project builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using OpenAI's GPT-4o (Omni) model and ObjectBox Vector Database. It combines powerful language understanding with efficient vector storage for enhanced data retrieval. The solution is optimized for fast, context-aware responses in large dataset applications.
